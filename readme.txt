Simple WooCommerce lets you customize your store from admin dashboard instead of digging into code.

== Description ==

WooCommerce lets you easily sell products or services online. A plugin allows you to create a working e-commerce store with basic features, however customizing your store to your preferences may require coding skills. This is why the Simple WooCommerce plugin can help you – we’ve made the most requested changes that aren’t available in the settings. That way, you can easily select the functions you want from the menu instead of digging into the code.
